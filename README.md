# Othello_Game

This repository features a comprehensive implementation of the Othello (Reversi) game, developed in C using the SDL library. The project includes the following components:

- **Game Logic:** Robust implementation of Othelloâ€™s core gameplay mechanics, including move validation, capture rules, and overall game state management.
- **Graphical User Interface:** A user-friendly, visually appealing interface built with SDL, providing an immersive and interactive gaming experience.
- **AI Opponent:** An intelligent AI opponent capable of competing against human players by leveraging heuristic strategies to make optimal decisions.
- **Save System:** A convenient feature that allows players to save their progress and resume games at a later time.

This project encapsulates both the strategic depth of Othello and the technical complexity of implementing a full-featured game in C with SDL.
